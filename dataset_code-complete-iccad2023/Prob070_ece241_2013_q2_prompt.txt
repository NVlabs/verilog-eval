A single-output digital system with four inputs (a,b,c,d) generates a
logic-1 when 2, 7, or 15 appears on the inputs, and a logic-0 when 0, 1,
4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14 appears. The input conditions for the numbers
3, 8, 11, and 12 never occur in this system. For example, 7 corresponds
to a,b,c,d being set to 0,1,1,1, respectively. Determine the output
out_sop in minimum sum-of-products form, and the output out_pos in
minimum product-of-sums form.
